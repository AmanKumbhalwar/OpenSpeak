# Virtual English Teacher App

![App Preview](app-preview.png) <!-- You can replace this with a screenshot of your app -->

## Project Overview

The Virtual English Teacher App is an immersive language learning platform designed to improve English communication skills. It facilitates real-time communication between students and a virtual teacher. The app leverages open APIs to provide accurate responses and uses text-to-speech (TTS) for lifelike interactions. An innovative feature of the app is lip synchronization, enhancing the realism of the virtual teacher's responses.

### Key Features

- **User Registration and Authentication:** Allows users to create accounts and log in as students or teachers.
- **Real-time Chat:** Enables real-time chat sessions between students and the virtual teacher.
- **Speech Synthesis:** Converts text-based responses into natural speech for an immersive experience.
- **Lip Synchronization:** Synchronizes the virtual teacher's lip movement with spoken words or sentences.
- **Open API Integration:** Gathers data from open APIs for accurate and relevant responses.
- **Teacher Dashboard:** Empowers educators to create lessons, quizzes, and educational materials.
- **User Progress Tracking:** Enables students to monitor their learning progress and review chat history.
- **Voice Recognition (Optional):** Provides the option for voice recognition to evaluate spoken English.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: Next.js, React
- Backend (if needed): Node.js, Express
- Real-time Communication: WebSocket
- Text-to-speech (TTS): Web Speech API or third-party TTS services
- Lip Synchronization: [Library or Tool Name]
